    <p style="font-size: 18px">Meet our Arab and Aussie biracial friend! She is also a staff of the Monsoon Review. Her
        name directly translates to "World" in English. Being kind and thoughtful towards everyone she meets,
        she strives to build a better reality for all. She prioritises others' feelings over her own. She is the moon of
        the group. A quiet person in real life, her mind constantly filled with thoughts and goals. She particularly
        enjoys things that allow her to spend a long time pondering upon. A true enthusiast of philosophy, she will never
        get enough of it. She is in charge of Arabic entries (Do include an English translation, though! Growing up in an
        English-speaking country, she is not very fluent in Arabic.) She hopes to be a safe place for all. She adores the
        act of kindness and treat people the way she would want to be treated, rather than treating them depending on
        whether they deserve it or not. Among her friends, she is often labelled as the peacemaker. She is true to people,
        and one need not be afraid to approach her. She promotes fairness, honesty, and loyalty. Such soul is difficult
        to encounter, Dunia is an irreplacable and priceless being. </p>

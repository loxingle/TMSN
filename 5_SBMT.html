    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Theme of Issue 01: <br>The Beginning. </h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px">Since this issue is the beginning of the Monsoon Review, we want
        works that highlight the beginning of something new. <br><br></p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center; color: LightGreen;">Submission Guidelines</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">We're looking for bizarre short fiction, particularly those that
        brings intrigue or deep ponder. We ask for works that each word matter in, works that bring meaning,
        and works that succeed in painting a clear picture for readers. <br><br>
    While we are not a genre-specific magazine, certain themes are preferred. We have different theme preferences,
        for example, adult fairy tales are encouraged (our staff Dunia loves them, along with crime and fantasy)
        (Bonus if they are dark and twisted. Well, that would very much attract Atlas. This includes horror and dark
        comedy). If your piece doesn't fit those genres, don't worry about it. Those are just little tips of what we
        like most. We just want to read the best you've got. <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">We're looking forward to see what you have for us! </p>
    <p></p>

        <br>
        <li>Please use a traditional font such as Times New Roman or Garamond.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Simultaneous submissions are allowed, but we encourage you to claim whether yours is one. Once accepted
            elsewhere, please email us stating your name and the title of your accepted work. We will later remove
            your piece from our list. The same goes to any request to remove your work from our site. </li>
        <br>
        <li>We do not tolerate racist, homophobic, abusive, and NSFW works. </li>
        <br>
        <li>You may submit up to two different works per issue. Submissions that contain more than two will be rejected. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Please do not surpass 2,000 words per story.</li>
        <br>
        <li>We accept work in PDF or Word file only. When you submit, please keep your works separated. </li>
        <br>
        <li>We reserve the right to edit any minor grammatical mistakes. </li>

        How to Submit:
        <br><br>
        <li>Please submit your work to <i>themonsoonreview@gmail.com</i>. </li>
        <br>
        <li>In the subject line, please specify the name of the issue you are submitting for, language, genre, and
            title of your work. <br> e.g. Issue 01, English, Horror, The Children. </li>
        <br>
        <li>In your cover letter, greetings can be as simple as "Dear Editors", to avoid misgendering or mislabelling
            us. </li>
        <br>
        <li>We understand how stressful writing a cover letter can be. For that reason, you are allowed skip the
            attempt to wow us in your letter as we will be paying more attention to your work(s) instead. But, if you
            do insist, you may write a cover letter too. We don't mind either option. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Please include a short third-person biography in your email. We encourage it to be around 50 words. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Please state whether it is a simultaneous submission. </li>
        <br>
        <li>If applicable, please include content and trigger warnings. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Please attach your file in the email. If you are submitting two works, attach both files. </li>
        <br>
